  <h2>Intro</h2>
    <img src="img/bio.jpg" alt="Emily Heffernan">
    <p class="bio">I grew up in Spokane Washington and went to high school at Gonzaga Prep. I am currently attending Eastern Washington University where I am studying Visual Communication Design (VCD). When I first started at Eastern I studied elementary education, I changed majors after hearing about the Visual Communication Design program. I am also taking class for a web design. I also found a love for photography when I changed majors. I knew that having skills of designing and making a website would be very handy if I wanted to pursue a career in photography. When taking VCD classes I also found that I loved designing as well.  </p>

    <p>I can work with adobe products, such as Illustrator, Photoshop and InDesign. I can work with adobe on both Windows and Mac. I am in the process of learning how to become proficient in creating websites. I am learning how to use InVision to make high fidelity prototypes. I am really just starting to really use these products, but I am willing and wanting to learn about different tools to use in creating designs and websites.</p>
